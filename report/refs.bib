  abstract = {In this article, we present a small, complete, and efficient SAT-solver in the style of conflict-driven learning, as exemplified by Chaff. We aim to give sufficient details about implementation to enable the reader to construct his or her own solver in a very short time. This will allow users of SAT-solvers to make domain specific extensions or adaptions of current state-of-the-art SAT-techniques, to meet the needs of a particular application area. The presented solver is designed with this in mind, and includes among other things a mechanism for adding arbitrary boolean constraints. It also supports solving a series of related SAT-problems efficiently by an incremental SAT-interface.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the encoding into CNF clauses of Boolean cardinality constraints that arise in many practical applications. The proposed encoding is efficient with respect to unit propagation, which is implemented in almost all complete CNF satisfiability solvers. We prove the practical efficiency of this encoding on some problems arising in discrete tomography that involve many cardinality constraints. This encoding is also used together with a trivial variable elimination in order to re-encode parity learning benchmarks so that a simple Davis and Putnam procedure can solve them.},
